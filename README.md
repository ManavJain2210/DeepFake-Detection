# DeepFake-Detection

## Introduction

Deep Fake Detection using Lip Sync is a project in which we have trained a model which can tell us whether a video is real or fake. Basically, a user can upload a video and the system will give an output as to whether the video is fake or real. The system makes use of facial expressions, lip movement, audio. This system, which combines these multiple aspects of a video is not easy to cheat unlike the previous systems which all checked only one of these aspects.

## Results
